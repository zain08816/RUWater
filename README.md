# Hack
Hackathon project in which nearby water refill stations are found and shown.

Custom water markers

Water stations are only marked if they are open to the public (excluding resident halls and some office buildings)

Build to reduce plastic bottle waste

Great for Rutgers Students, and anyone visiting the campus!

# Implementation

Webpage made from HTML and CSS

Hosted using GithubPages
